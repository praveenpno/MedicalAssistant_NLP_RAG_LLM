        "\n",
        "Here are some observations comparing the responses generated with prompt engineering to the initial responses from the LLM:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Query 1: What is the protocol for managing sepsis in a critical care unit?**\n",
        "*   With prompt engineering, the model's response for sepsis management was quite different. Instead of giving a partial protocol like before, it explicitly stated it couldn't give an exact answer without more context but then provided general key components. This shows the prompt engineering successfully guided the model to acknowledge limitations and stick to general knowledge when specific context isn't provided. It's more cautious and upfront about what it doesn't know from the \"context.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Query 2: What are the common symptoms for appendicitis, and can it be cured via medicine? If not, what surgical procedure should be followed to treat it?**\n",
        "*   The prompt-engineered response for appendicitis was much clearer about its source of information. It stated it couldn't confirm a diagnosis from the text but could provide general medical knowledge. It then gave a good list of symptoms and correctly explained that surgery (appendectomy) is typically required, not just medicine. This was a more structured and informative answer compared to the initial one, which felt incomplete.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Query 3: What are the effective treatments or solutions for addressing sudden patchy hair loss, commonly seen as localized bald spots on the scalp, and what could be the possible causes behind it?**\n",
        "*   For patchy hair loss, the prompt-engineered response also emphasized the lack of specific context in the \"provided information.\" It then defaulted to providing general knowledge about causes and treatments for alopecia areata. While the initial LLM response was already relatively decent for this query, the prompt-engineered version clearly highlights that its answer is based on general knowledge because the specific context wasn't present.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Query 4: What treatments are recommended for a person who has sustained a physical injury to brain tissue, resulting in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function?**\n",
        "*   The prompt-engineered response for brain injury treatments again started by saying it couldn't give an accurate answer without more specific details from the context. It then listed some common treatments like medication, rehabilitation therapies, and in severe cases, surgery or assistive devices. This response, while general, was more structured and clearly indicated that it was pulling from its broader knowledge base due to the lack of specific context in the input provided to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Query 5: What are the necessary precautions and treatment steps for a person who has fractured their leg during a hiking trip, and what should be considered for their care and recovery?**\n",
        "*   The prompt-engineered response for the fractured leg scenario also started with an assumption (\"I'm assuming that you have already assessed the severity...\") and then provided general information based on what it knows medically. It gave a good list of steps, including RICE, immobilization, pain relief, and seeking medical attention. Compared to the initial response, this felt more like a comprehensive first-aid and initial care guide, clearly drawing from its general medical knowledge when the context wasn't specific.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, I feel like the prompt engineering did a better job when compared to the first set of queries"

These ticks are the natural reservoirs. Dermacentor andersoni  (wood tick) is the principal vector\\nin the western US. D. variabilis (dog tick) is the vector in the eastern and southern US. RMSF is probably\\nnot transmitted directly from person to person.\\nPathophysiology\\nSmall blood vessels are the sites of the characteristic pathologic lesions. Rickettsiae propagate within\\ndamaged endothelial cells, and vessels may become blocked by thrombi, producing vasculitis in the skin,\\nsubcutaneous tissues, CNS, lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, and spleen. Disseminated intravascular\\ncoagulation often occurs in severely ill patients (see p. 976).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe incubation period averages 7 days but varies from 3 to 12 days; the shorter the incubation period,\\nthe more severe the infection. Onset is abrupt, with severe headache, chills, prostration, and muscular\\npains. Fever reaches 39.5 to 40° C within several days and remains high (for 15 to 20 days in severe\\ncases), although morning remissions may occur. Between the 1st and 6th day of fever, most patients\\ndevelop a rash on the wrists, ankles, palms, soles, and forearms that rapidly extends to the neck, face,\\naxillae, buttocks, and trunk. Initially macular and pink, it becomes maculopapular and darker. In about 4\\ndays, the lesions become petechial and may coalesce to form large hemorrhagic areas that later ulcerate.\\nNeurologic symptoms include headache, restlessness, insomnia, delirium, and coma, all indicative of\\nencephalitis. Hypotension develops in severe cases. Hepatomegaly may be present, but jaundice is\\ninfrequent. Nausea and vomiting are common. Localized pneumonitis may occur. Untreated patients may\\ndevelop pneumonia, tissue necrosis, and circulatory failure, sometimes with brain and heart damage.\\nCardiac arrest with sudden death occasionally occurs in fulminant cases.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 139.

Initially macular and pink, it becomes maculopapular and darker. In about 4\\ndays, the lesions become petechial and may coalesce to form large hemorrhagic areas that later ulcerate.\\nNeurologic symptoms include headache, restlessness, insomnia, delirium, and coma, all indicative of\\nencephalitis. Hypotension develops in severe cases. Hepatomegaly may be present, but jaundice is\\ninfrequent. Nausea and vomiting are common. Localized pneumonitis may occur. Untreated patients may\\ndevelop pneumonia, tissue necrosis, and circulatory failure, sometimes with brain and heart damage.\\nCardiac arrest with sudden death occasionally occurs in fulminant cases.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 139.

Pain increases with cough and motion. Classic signs are right lower quadrant direct and rebound tenderness located at McBurney's point. Additional signs include pain felt in the right lower quadrant with palpation of the left lower quadrant (Rovsing sign), an increase in pain from passive extension of the right hip joint that stretches the iliopsoas muscle (psoas sign), or pain caused by passive internal rotation of the flexed thigh (obturator sign). Low-grade fever is common. Unfortunately, these classic findings appear in less than 50% of patients, and many variations of symptoms and signs occur. Pain may not be localized, particularly in infants and children. Tenderness may be diffuse or absent. Bowel movements are usually less frequent or absent; if diarrhea is a sign, a retrocecal appendix should be suspected. RBCs or WBCs may be present in the urine. Atypical symptoms are common among elderly patients and pregnant women.\\nAppendicitis cannot be cured via medicine alone. The standard treatment for appendicitis is surgical removal of the appendix, which can usually be done even if perforated. Occasionally, the appendix is difficult to locate, in which case it usually lies behind the cecum or the ileum and mesentery of the right colon. A contraindication to appendectomy is inflammatory bowel disease involving the cecum. However, in cases of terminal ileitis and a normal cecum, the appendix should be removed. Appendectomy should be preceded by IV antibiotics, and third-generation cephalosporins are preferred. For nonperforated appendicitis, no further antibiotics are required. If the appendix is perforated, antibiotics should be continued until the patient's temperature and WBC count have normalized or for a fixed course according to the surgeon's preference. If surgery is impossible, antibiotics improve the survival rate but do not cure the condition. When a large inflammatory mass is found involving the appendix, terminal ileum, and\""

The cause of alopecia areata is believed to be an autoimmune disorder affecting genetically susceptible individuals exposed to unclear environmental triggers. It is important to note that the efficacy of these treatments may vary, and some may have adverse effects such as decreased libido, erectile and ejaculatory dysfunction, hypersensitivity reactions, gynecomastia, myopathy, and a decrease in prostate-specific antigen levels in older men. Common practice is to continue treatment for as long as positive results persist, but once treatment is stopped, hair loss returns to previous levels. Finasteride is not indicated for women and is contraindicated in pregnant women due to its teratogenic effects in animals. Hormonal modulators such as oral contraceptives or spironolactone may be useful for female-pattern hair loss associated with hyperandrogenemia. Surgical options include follicle transplant, scalp flaps, and alopecia reduction, but few procedures have been subjected to scientific scrutiny. Patients who are self-conscious about their hair loss may consider these options. Underlying disorders should be treated for hair loss due to causes other than alopecia areata.'"

              "\"The common symptoms for appendicitis include epigastric or periumbilical pain followed by brief nausea, vomiting, and anorexia; after a few hours, the pain shifts to the right lower quadrant. Pain increases with cough and motion. Classic signs are right lower quadrant direct and rebound tenderness located at McBurney's point (junction of the middle and outer thirds of the line joining the umbilicus to the anterior superior spine). Additional signs include pain felt in the right lower quadrant with palpation of the left lower quadrant (Rovsing sign), an increase in pain from passive extension of the right hip joint that stretches the iliopsoas muscle (psoas sign), or pain caused by passive internal rotation of the flexed thigh (obturator sign). Low-grade fever is common. Unfortunately, these classic findings appear in less than 50% of patients, and many variations of symptoms and signs occur. Pain may not be localized, particularly in infants and children. Tenderness may be diffuse or absent. Bowel movements are usually less frequent or absent; if diarrhea is a sign, a retrocecal appendix should be suspected. RBCs or WBCs may be present in the urine. Atypical symptoms are common among elderly patients and pregnant women.\\nAppendicitis cannot be cured via medicine alone as it requires surgical removal of the inflamed appendix to prevent complications such as perforation, gangrene, and peritonitis. The treatment is open or laparoscopic appendectomy. If surgery is impossible, antibiotics can improve the survival rate but are not curative. When a large inflammatory mass is found involving the appendix, terminal ileum, and cecum, resection of the entire mass and ileocolostomy may be preferable. In late cases in which a pericolic abscess has already formed, the abscess is drained either by an ultrasound-guided percutaneous catheter or by open operation (with appendectomy to follow at a later date). A Meckel's diverticulum in a patient under the age of 40 should be removed concomitantly with the appendectomy unless extensive inflammation around the appendix prevents the procedure.\""

The efficacy is usually evident within 6 to 8 months of treatment. Common practice is to continue treatment for as long as positive results persist, and once treatment is stopped, hair loss returns to previous levels. Other causes of sudden patchy hair loss include fungal infections such as tinea capitis, which can be treated with topical or oral antifungals.

        "**Groundedness**: The RAG responses consistently received high groundedness scores (mostly 5s). This indicates that the answers generated by the RAG system were well-supported by the provided context from the Merck Manual. The model, in its evaluator role, confirmed that it could trace the information back to the source documents—a key strength of the RAG approach.\n",

        "**Relevance**: Similarly, the RAG responses scored high on relevance (mostly 5s).

The evaluator found the answers to be direct and fully aligned with the user's intent.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Actionable Insights**:\n",
        "\n",
        "**RAG is Crucial for Medical Accuracy:** The RAG approach, leveraging the Merck Manual, significantly improved the accuracy, completeness, and specificity of responses compared to using the base LLM or prompt engineering alone. This highlights that for domain-specific, factual information like medical knowledge, grounding the LLM with relevant external data is essential.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prompt Engineering Enhances Structure and Awareness**: While not sufficient on its own for detailed medical answers, prompt engineering helped structure the responses and made the model aware of the importance of using the provided context. This is valuable for controlling the model's behavior and ensuring it adheres to instructions (like only using the provided context).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Base LLM Limitations for Specialized Domains:** The initial LLM responses, without external knowledge, were often general, incomplete, and sometimes inaccurate for medical queries. This reinforces that relying solely on a general-purpose LLM is insufficient for tasks requiring deep domain expertise.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Chunking and Embedding Effectiveness:** The process of chunking the PDF and creating embeddings was effective in preparing the data for retrieval. The high relevance scores in the RAG evaluation indicate that the embedding model and retrieval mechanism successfully identified relevant document sections for the given queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**LLM-as-a-Judge Validation:** Using an LLM as a judge for groundedness and relevance proved to be a valuable method for evaluating the RAG system's performance objectively. This approach can be incorporated into a continuous evaluation pipeline for monitoring the system's quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Business Recommendations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prioritize RAG Implementation:** Given the significant improvement in accuracy and completeness, healthcare organizations should prioritize implementing a RAG-based system for accessing medical knowledge. This directly addresses the challenge of information overload and supports better decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Invest in High-Quality Knowledge:** The success of the RAG system is heavily reliant on the quality and comprehensiveness of the external knowledge base (like the Merck Manual). Continuously updating and expanding the medical knowledge base is crucial for maintaining the system's effectiveness.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Develop a User-Friendly Interface:** A user-friendly interface is essential for healthcare professionals to easily pose questions and interpret the AI-generated responses. The interface should clearly present the source of the information (e.g., section of the Merck Manual) to build trust and allow for verification.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Consider Fine-tuning for Specific Sub-domains:** While the general Merck Manual is comprehensive, fine-tuning the system on more specialized medical sub-domains or internal protocols could further enhance accuracy and relevance for specific departments or use cases.\n",
